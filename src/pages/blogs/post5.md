## Introduction

The **Compiler** and Interpreter, both have similar works to perform. Interpreters and Compilers convert the Source Code (HLL) to Machine Code (understandable by Computer). In general, computer programs exist in High-Level Language that a human being can easily understand. But computers cannot understand the same high-level language, so for computers, we have to convert them into machine language and make them readable. In this article, we are going to see the differences between them.


# What is a Compiler?

The Compiler is a translator that takes input i.e., High-Level Language, and produces an output of low-level language i.e. machine or assembly language. The work of a Compiler is to transform the codes written in the programming language into machine code (format of 0s and 1s) so that computers can understand.

* A compiler is more intelligent than an *assembler* it checks all kinds of limits, ranges, errors, etc.

* But its program run time is longer and occupies a larger part of memory. It has a slow speed because a compiler goes through the entire program and then translates the entire program into machine codes.


### Role of a Compiler

For Converting the code written in a high-level language into machine-level language so that computers can easily understand, we use a compiler. Converts basically convert high-level language to intermediate assembly language by a compiler and then assembled into machine code by an assembler.

### Advantages of Compiler
* Compiled code runs faster in comparison to Interpreted code.
* Compilers help improve the security of Applications.
* Compilers give Debugging tools, which help in fixing errors easily.

&nbsp; 
### Disadvantages of Compiler

* The compiler can catch only syntax errors and some semantic errors .
* Compilation can take more time in the case of bulky code.

# What is an Interpreter?

An Interpreter is a program that translates a programming language into a comprehensible language. The interpreter converts high-level language to an intermediate language. It contains pre-compiled code, source code, etc.

* It translates only one statement of the program at a time.
* Interpreters, more often than not are smaller than compilers.

&nbsp; 
### Role of an Interpreter

The simple role of an interpreter is to translate the material into a target language. An Interpreter works line by line on a code. It also converts high-level language to machine language.

## Advantages of Interpreter

* Programs written in an Interpreted language are easier to debug.
* Interpreters allow the management of memory automatically, which reduces memory error risks.
* Interpreted Language is more flexible than a Compiled language.

&nbsp; 
## Disadvantages of Interpreter

* The interpreter can run only the corresponding Interpreted program.
* Interpreted code runs slower in comparison to Compiled code.

### Conclusion

In summary, compilers and interpreters both serve the purpose of converting high-level code into something a computer can understand, but they do so in different ways. A compiler translates the whole program at once, which can make it run faster but takes more time to compile. An interpreter translates and runs the code line by line, making it easier to catch errors and debug, though it may run slower.
